### Key Features Enabled:

- âœ… **Azure CNI Networking** with custom CIDR ranges
- âœ… **NAT Gateway** for secure outbound connectivity  
- âœ… **Network Security Groups** with HTTP/HTTPS rules
- âœ… **Container Registry Integration** with AcrPull permissions
- âœ… **Container Insights** monitoring enabled
- âœ… **User-Assigned Managed Identity** for AKS
- âœ… **Workload Identity** support configured
- âœ… **Storage Account** with blob containers for logs/backups
- âœ… **Application Insights** for application monitoring
- âœ… **Route Tables** for custom routing

### Security Configurations:

- ðŸ”’ **RBAC Enabled** on AKS cluster
- ðŸ”’ **Private Storage Containers** for sensitive data
- ðŸ”’ **Network Security Groups** controlling traffic
- ðŸ”’ **Managed Identities** instead of service principals
- ðŸ”’ **HTTPS Traffic Only** enforced on storage
- ðŸ”’ **TLS 1.2 Minimum** version on storage

### Next Steps:

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**: `terraform apply -var-file="./environments/dev/terraform.tfvars"`
2. **Connect to Cluster**: `az aks get-credentials --resource-group rg-aks-dev --name aks-dev-cluster-dev`
3. **Verify Deployment**: `kubectl get nodes`
4. **Access Container Registry**: Use admin credentials or integrate with AKS
5. **Monitor Resources**: Access Log Analytics workspace and Application Insights
